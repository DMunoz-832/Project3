    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey I'm Daniela Munoz, a first-year ITM major with a growing interest in cybersecurity (blue team). I'm from the East Side, Chicago, IL if you
        don't know where that is I don't blame you. The three white stripes on the city flag account for all 3 major sides (North, West, South) but
        always falls short to mention the East side. Outside of school, I enjoy biking if weather permits whether its along the lake or to one of 
        Indiana's well-kept parks. Outside of biking I enjoy completing lego sets, so far I only have an old train set, the Aston Martin 007, and the
        Saturn V which has been my favorite build so far as the interior build was clean and so symmetrical.</p>
